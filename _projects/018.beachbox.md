## Background
For beach goers, our personal belongings are subject to environmental damage and vulnerable for theft.  My client's hypothesis was that a solution existed in which both of these problems could be ammended.

## Description
Working primarily as the designer and technical expert for this client, a watertight latching container was designed for purposes of storing and protecting personal goods.  It features a 5 piece configuration: a primary compartment with hollow walls for insulation, a snap-in lid, an overcentered latch, a cam, and combination lock.

Upon meeting the design objectives and verifying ease of assembly and manufacturability, I provided my client with a prototype of their unit that demonstrated their key operating principles.  This was used in a pitching competition, and the rest has yet to be determined.
